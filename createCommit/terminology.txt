Repository---------
A repsitory is a collection of files and directories that are stored together.
It is a way to store and manage your code.
It allows VCS to track the changes in the project files.


// Config Settings-------
There is a config file that stores all the setings that you have changed, like email, username and what editor you would like to use.

There are some global settings and some repository specific setings.

set global email
(git config --global user.email "Your-Email")
set global username
(git config --global user.name "Your Name")

Now you can check your config settings:
(git config --list)
